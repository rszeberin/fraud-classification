## Classification of financial transactions to detect fraud

The aim of this study is to flag fraudulent financial transactions. Thus, we use the IEEE fraud dataset to compare several classification methods, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, k Nearest Neighbors and Random Forests. In this study we refrained to apply boosting algorithms that are known for their superior performance for this problem.
